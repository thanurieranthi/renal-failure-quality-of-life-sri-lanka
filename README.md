# Investigating the Quality of Life of Renal Failure Patients in Sri Lanka

This repository contains the final report for a statistical project analyzing the quality of life among renal failure patients in Sri Lanka using secondary data and SPSS software.

## ðŸ“„ Project Overview

Renal failure significantly impacts patients' physical, mental, and social well-being. This study investigates how different socioeconomic and health-related factors influence the quality of life of individuals diagnosed with renal failure.

- **Dataset**: 537 records collected by the National Institute of Canine Service and Training (NICST), Sri Lanka.
- **Response Variable**: SF-36 Score (quality of life index)
- **Tools Used**: SPSS, MS Excel

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- Identify variables associated with quality of life among renal failure patients.
- Test if quality of life varies by:
  - Gender
  - Education level
  - Number of children

## ðŸ§ª Methodology

- Univariate and bivariate descriptive analysis
- Correlation and association tests
- Advanced statistical analysis using Mann-Whitney U test, Kruskal-Wallis test, and Multiple Linear Regression (transformed model)

## ðŸ“Š Key Findings

- SF-36 score negatively correlates with age and DSI (Dialysis Symptom Index) score.
- Higher income and professional occupation positively impact the quality of life.
- Education level and number of children were not statistically significant at the 5% level in advanced testing.
